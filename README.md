Codes for Raspberry Pi Pico W (WLAN)
In this area I will collect and provide you with several code examples for the Raspberry Pi Pico W (WLAN) over time. They can of course be used freely. You are welcome to copy the code and adapt it to your needs.

The following is required, but I won't go into detail about it: Of course you need a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller. You can get it from numerous suppliers, Raspberry Pi, Amazon, Pimoroni and many others. You will also need PIN strips that you have to solder on the board. Also a cable for programming the Pico W to your computer. I recommend using the ThonnyIDE for programming.

In my first example I use a BME280 breakout sensor (also available from Pimoroni.com). You may also have to solder it with PINs or order a so-called breakout garden right away, then it just has to be plugged in.

You will also need to download the library for Micropython_bme280. I also use the ThonnyIDE and the Install Plugin function.
How to start with the Raspberry Pi Pico and where to find the right .uf2 file, etc. is described in detail on the Raspberry Pi website, among other things. I won't go any further into this either.

I wish you lots of fun and success with the examples!
